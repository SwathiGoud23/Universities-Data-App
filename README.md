## run the backend by cd into api folder and running the command  node index.js

## start the react app by running npm start in my-app

## considering the time, all the api call functions are added but in the frontend only the list of institutions are displayed and can also add an institution and add it to the list successfully.

## worked out the same in redux, to show how it works on Redux, just need to uncomment the code in Pages/Institutions.js and the root index.js

## Added Typescript implementation in the same file Institution.js which is uncommented but it doesn't work because packages are not installed, it's just to show the implementation of the Typescript.

## considering the time the styles are not applied much, but the styles are added in .scss file.
